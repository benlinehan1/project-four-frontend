        articleHeading1: "The History of this Iconic House.",
        paragraphs: ["Like most of the iconic fashion houses that dominate the fashion world today, Schiaparelli is a house which has been steeped in history. The Schiaparelli House was founded in 1927 by Elsa Schiaparelli when she release her first collection 'Pour le Sport'. A collection which primarily was advertised as ready to wear and sportswear garments. However, the fashion house didn't hit its peak until approximately the 1930s.",
        "One of the main points of interest in their history was Elsa Schiaparelli's rivalry with Coco Chanel. The differences between these Houses were first seen in their designs, Chanel often opting for more androgynous styled womenswear whereas Schiaparelli would often focus on the beauty of femininity and more spirited designs. Eventually, Schiaparelli moved into designing evening wear garments. Later becoming known for designing the first women's evening jacket. This jacket was revolutionary for female socialites, allowing them to be both stylish during the night while also maintaining warmth and comfort.",
        "Schiaparelli was also renowned in the fashion scene for utilising a wealth of different clothing mechanisms and experimental fabrics. Before zippers were commonplace in fashion, Schiaparelli utilised them in her pieces around the beginning of 1935. Schiaparelli also used a variety of different materials, ranging from leather to beads, and at times strangely enough even plastic. As an artistic choice, Schiaparelli would often make a point of utilising unorthodox fabrics that many in the fashion world would consider an affront to create controversy and discourse.",
        "To continue on regarding Chanel and Schiaparelli's feud, at the time in the 1930's it was said that the general consensus of those within Paris did not know much about why's and how's of why the two most prominent fashion designers within the city hated each other so. But, it was evident to those 'in the know' that at times the hatred was seemingly incredibly one-sided. As Chanel grew in popularity in the decade between 1920 and 1930 with the Upper Class of Paris, she began to see the figureheads of other up and coming fashion houses as threats. Elsa Schiaparelli, was one of these threats. Coco Chanel was said to have vehemently despised the up and coming design her, namely because Schiaparelli had little to no formal training in sewing and would often design clothing by simply draping fabric over a body. Sources have sais that at the time Chanel would have found the success of an unskilled designer insulting. But, to her credit, Coco Chanel did not deny Schiaparelli's creativity. Being quotes as referring to Elsa as 'that Italian artist who makes clothes'.",
        "Their rivaly was said to reach a fever pitch, excuse the pun, when at a costume ball before the beginning of World War Two Chanel was said to have 'accidentally' set Schiaparelli on fire. When the two were dancing, Chanel made sure to guide her rival unknowingly into a chandelier adorned with lit candles, setting her ablaze. Of course, Schiaparelli survived. However, she did have to endure the embarassment of being put out with soda water by guests that were all too happy to see her downfall.",
        "Unfortunately, it was found that the times were not kind to the House of Schiaparelli or the House of Chanel. Both were similar in the fact that they had forged fashion empires, yet Chanel's was the one that ended up being able to survive. Schiaparelli was forced to close the doors of her atelier in the year of 1954, while her rival had released her renowned Boucl√© suit which was desired the world over.",
        "This was not the last time that the world was graced by the presence of the Schiaparelli House of fashion however. In 2013, Schiaparelli was reopened when Marco Zanini revealed details of the iconic brands revival. Since then, the Maison has released some of it's most incredible work yet. Seamlessly blending chic and surrealism, while also incorporating Elsa Schiaparelli's unique vision of fashion."
