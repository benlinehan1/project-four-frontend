        title: "Schiaparelli's Revolutionary Take on Surrealistic Fashion",

        articleHeading1: "The History of this Iconic House.",
        paragraphs: ["Like most of the iconic fashion houses that dominate the fashion world today, Schiaparelli is a house which has been steeped in history. The Schiaparelli House was founded in 1927 by Elsa Schiaparelli when she release her first collection 'Pour le Sport'. A collection which primarily was advertised as ready to wear and sportswear garments. However, the fashion house didn't hit its peak until approximately the 1930s.",
        "One of the main points of interest in their history was Elsa Schiaparelli's rivalry with Coco Chanel. The differences between these Houses were first seen in their designs, Chanel often opting for more androgynous styled womenswear whereas Schiaparelli would often focus on the beauty of femininity and more spirited designs. Eventually, Schiaparelli moved into designing evening wear garments. Later becoming known for designing the first women's evening jacket. This jacket was revolutionary for female socialites, allowing them to be both stylish during the night while also maintaining warmth and comfort.",
        "Schiaparelli was also renowned in the fashion scene for utilising a wealth of different clothing mechanisms and experimental fabrics. Before zippers were commonplace in fashion, Schiaparelli utilised them in her pieces around the beginning of 1935. Schiaparelli also used a variety of different materials, ranging from leather to beads, and at times strangely enough even plastic. As an artistic choice, Schiaparelli would often make a point of utilising unorthodox fabrics that many in the fashion world would consider an affront to create controversy and discourse.",
        "To continue on regarding Chanel and Schiaparelli's feud, at the time in the 1930's it was said that the general consensus of those within Paris did not know much about why's and how's of why the two most prominent fashion designers within the city hated each other so. But, it was evident to those 'in the know' that at times the hatred was seemingly incredibly one-sided. As Chanel grew in popularity in the decade between 1920 and 1930 with the Upper Class of Paris, she began to see the figureheads of other up and coming fashion houses as threats. Elsa Schiaparelli, was one of these threats. Coco Chanel was said to have vehemently despised the up and coming design her, namely because Schiaparelli had little to no formal training in sewing and would often design clothing by simply draping fabric over a body. Sources have sais that at the time Chanel would have found the success of an unskilled designer insulting. But, to her credit, Coco Chanel did not deny Schiaparelli's creativity. Being quotes as referring to Elsa as 'that Italian artist who makes clothes'.",
        "Their rivaly was said to reach a fever pitch, excuse the pun, when at a costume ball before the beginning of World War Two Chanel was said to have 'accidentally' set Schiaparelli on fire. When the two were dancing, Chanel made sure to guide her rival unknowingly into a chandelier adorned with lit candles, setting her ablaze. Of course, Schiaparelli survived. However, she did have to endure the embarassment of being put out with soda water by guests that were all too happy to see her downfall.",
        "Unfortunately, it was found that the times were not kind to the House of Schiaparelli or the House of Chanel. Both were similar in the fact that they had forged fashion empires, yet Chanel's was the one that ended up being able to survive. Schiaparelli was forced to close the doors of her atelier in the year of 1954, while her rival had released her renowned Boucl√© suit which was desired the world over.",
        "This was not the last time that the world was graced by the presence of the Schiaparelli House of fashion however. In 2013, Schiaparelli was reopened when Marco Zanini revealed details of the iconic brands revival. Since then, the Maison has released some of it's most incredible work yet. Seamlessly blending chic and surrealism, while also incorporating Elsa Schiaparelli's unique vision of fashion."

        "Online media is increasingly influential in fashion. It is difficult to talk about fashion in the abstract, without a human body before my eyes, without drawings, without a choice of fabric - without a practical or visual reality. I believe that my clothes can give people a better image of themselves - that it can increase their feelings of confidence and happiness. I believe that my clothes can give people a better image of themselves - that it can increase their feelings of confidence and happiness. My learning process is by eye alone; it's not at all scientific. Even Michelangelo got paid for doing the Sistine Chapel. To those artists who say they're doing it for the love of art, I say: Get real. Don't dress to kill, dress to survive. Dressing is a way of life. Nostalgia is a very complicated subject for me. I'm attracted by nostalgia but I refuse it intellectually. I truly believe that philanthropy and commerce can work together."]

        paragraphs: ["For me, art is about learning and about living with people. It's alive. I am convinced that you don't need to spend a fortune to look like a million. If you wear clothes that don't suit you, you're a fashion victim. You have to wear clothes that make you look better. I've treated the waistcoat as if it were a corset, so that it becomes the first layer in the process of putting clothes on the body. There is constant motion between layering and revealing. My job is to bring out in people what they wouldn't dare do themselves. Fashion moves so quickly that, unless you have a strong point of view, you can lose integrity. I am especially grateful that I have been able to keep my own style over the decades, in spite of the many changes that have taken place in the world of fashion and in its business. There are only three things I can do - make a dress, decorate a house, and entertain people. Dressing is a way of life. I want to thank all the women who have worn my clothes, the famous and the unknown, who have been so faithful to me and given me so much joy.",
        "Elegance is not the prerogative of those who have just escaped from adolescence, but of those who have already taken possession of their future. Fashion should be fun. It shouldn't be labelled intellectual. I didn't want to be a fashion designer, and for a good half of my career I didn't like it. I always wanted to do other things. I believe in comfort. If you don't feel comfortable in your clothes, it's hard to think of anything else. Over the years I have learned that what is important in a dress is the woman who is wearing it."],
